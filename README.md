# PyFCS: A new Python library to create and manipulate Fuzzy Color Spaces
PyFCS is a Python library that introduces fuzzy color spaces for a more realistic and flexible representation of color, overcoming the limitations of traditional methods. It is based on the previous work of the Java library JFCS and utilizes fuzzy logic and conceptual space theory, leveraging Python's strengths for data and image analysis.

### How to use
To get started, you can clone the .git repository or download the library as a .zip file using the `Clone or Download` option. 

If you don't need to make any modifications, we suggest following these steps:
1. Download the library as a .zip file from the "Clone or Download" option or from the releases section.
2. Unzip the file into a local folder.
3. Navigate to the _PyFCS_ directory at the root of the project using the command line (`cd`).
4. Run the following command:
```
python test\color_percentage.py
```

_color_percentage_ is just an example of the test programs; it can be run with all the files present in that test directory.
